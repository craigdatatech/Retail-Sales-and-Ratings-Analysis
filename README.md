# Retail Store Insights

## The purpose of this project was to provide insight to the business about which items were performing best and worthy of more promotion, and where to focus further investigation as why products may be underperforming to make relevant sales and buying decisions.
_Using SQL I was able to filter the categories of products and average rating to determine that the Premium Coffee Maker was the product with highest rating, and the Smart Home Security Camera the least_
_With this information, suggestions for the business are to consider how much marketing has been spent on each product, the demographic of they buyers, and the seasonal purchases to uncover areas of opportunity to exploit high sales in the Coffee Maker, and to uncover gaps for why the Security Camera has not performed as well_
