# Retail Sales and Product Rating Insights

## The purpose of this project was to provide insight to the business about which items were performing best and worthy of more promotion, and where to focus investigation as to why products may be underperforming to ultimately make relevant sales and marketing decisions.

## Results

After importing the sales data into Tableau, I related the tables to examine any correlation betweeen Price and Average Product Rating.

The ultimate determination was that there was no direct correlation between Price and Average Rating, which highlighted the need for further investigation into the reasons behind this such as marketing, the demgraphic of the buyers, and seasonal purchases etc.

## Process

_Using SQL I was able to filter the categories of products and average rating to determine that the Premium Coffee Maker was the product with highest rating, and the Smart Home Security Camera the least._ 

_With this information, the immediate points for the business were to consider how much marketing has been spent on each product, the demographic of they buyers, and the seasonal purchases to uncover areas of opportunity to exploit high sales in the Coffee Maker, and to uncover gaps for why the Security Camera has not performed as well_

_Still, it was possible to uncover some more meaningful patterns by relating the data, so I also identifed the product price ranges to be able to do so_ 

Finally, in order to discover insights into the sales data I imported the sales data into Tableau, and related the tables to examine any correlation betweeen Price and Average Product Rating.
